        Exercise
      </Heading>
      <Text>
        You need to build a form that validates data when submit button is
        pressed with all errors shown to the user as presented in the screenshot
        below.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        We have provided some tests with this project. Use these tests to help
        shape the UI interactions and write a matching zod schema to validate
        the form. Your task is to write the code that makes tests pass and build
        UI that works as expected.
      </Text>

      <Text>
        Use your imagination when building the form. If you build what is
        presented in the screenshot, it should be sufficient, but if you want to
        make it fancier - all the more power to you!

        <Box>
          <Image src={FormErrorImage} alt="Form with errors" />
          <Text as="i">Form with errors</Text>

        Your solution
      </Heading>
      <Text>
        Your solution must be submitted in the form of a CodeSandbox link. Clone
        this project to start coding away.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        If you choose to code directly in CodeSandbox, there's nothing else for
        you to set up. You may have to enable a few more panels in the interface
        to see test and console output.

      <Text>
        This is an "open book test" - feel free to learn as you go by browsing
        documentation and any resource you can find on the web.{' '}
      </Text>
      <Text>
        Make as many specs pass as you can, but don't be discouraged if you
        can't do it all.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        We expect that you will be able to inspect the code and understand how
        to run the tests and be able to navigate and understand the codebase.{' '}

        This exercise may feel very specific regarding the tools we chose to
        work with, however they were chosen so that you can get a taste of what
        Ignition Engineers are dealing with on a day-to-day basis. If this is up
        your alley, we'll be happy to chat with you.{' '}
